Please review the entirety of this document before opening an issue or submitting a pull request; doing so ensures the process is easy and effective for everyone involved.

## Getting Started with UW REACT

This project is just one of many autonomous robotics endeavours undertaken by UW REACT.

### What is UW REACT?

The [University of Waterloo Robotics Engineering and Autonomous Controls Team (UW REACT)](https://uwreact.ca) is a student design team composed primarily of undergraduate students at the University of Waterloo. We design, manufacture, program, and train fully autonomous FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) robots. We field a new robot each year to compete against high school FRC teams without using a human driver.

### How can I help?

Depending on your situation, there are two main ways to collaborate:

- **Like normal:** Just like any open source team, we maintain an active issue tracker and review pull requests as often as possible, allowing anyone to collaborate on GitHub.
- **Join our team:** If you are a student at the University of Waterloo, you can [apply to join our core team](https://uwreact.ca/apply) to gain access to Slack and push permissions to this repository.

### Opening Issues

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/uwreact/frc_control/issues) is our preferred method for reporting bugs and suggesting features. We ask that you:

- **DO** check if a similar issue has already been reported.
- **DO** follow the issue templates for the type of issue you are opening.
- **DO** label the issue with the labels specified in the template.
- **DO NOT** use the issue tracker for personal support requests. Email [hello@uwreact.ca](mailto:hello@uwreact.ca).
- **DO NOT** derail or troll issues. Keep discussion on topic.
- **DO NOT** post '+1' or 'üëç' comments. Use GitHub reactions for this.

### Submitting Pull Requests

Never embark on a pull request before selecting an issue to solve. If no similar issue exists, please open one first and wait for feedback before proceeding. If you submit a pull request that does not address an open issue, you may spend a lot of time writing changes that we may not merge into the project.

The easiest way to get started once you've selected an issue is:

1. [Fork the project](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).

2. Clone your fork:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/frc_control.git
```

3. Configure your remotes:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/uwreact/frc_control.git
```

4. Get the latest changes:

```bash
git checkout kinetic-devel
git pull upstream kinetic-devel
```

5. Create a new branch off of `kinetic-devel`:

```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

6. Commit your changes.

7. Locally merge the upstream branch into your branch:

```bash
git pull upstream kinetic-devel
```

8. [Open a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)

### Good First Issues

If you're not sure where to start, we maintain a list of [good first issues](https://github.com/uwreact/frc_control/labels/good%20first%20issue) with a limited scope for each of our projects.
